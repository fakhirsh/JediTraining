Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2010

Questions that I had in my mind while doing this course:
----------------------------------------------------------

1. Differentiation -- Session 1, 2:
-----------------------------------

Q1) How do we cut a cone using a plane so that it gives us the hyperbola "1/x" (because this particular curve has a weird skewed shape. Pertty hard to imagine the resulting cross-section unless the cones are themselves skewed somehow.)

Q2) The "difference quotient" formula for differentiation has delta x or dx in the denominator where dx -> 0. We can't just put dx to 0 "INITIALLY" because that'll give us 0/0. But after simplifying the formla (and some cancellations), as a very last step we plug 0 to dx and everything works out magically ! So What is happening here? Is the simplification process changing anything? (eventhough it shouldn't)
